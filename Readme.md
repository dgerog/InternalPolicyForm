# Internal Policy Form ([www.fcc.gov](FCC) - Federal Communications Commission)
    
This is      I created (**STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT**) to replicate the [https://www.fcc.gov/cyberplanner](FCC) Cyber Planner form.

# How it works?

Once the plugin is installed, put the `fcc_internal_policy_form` shortcode in your related page and the form will be drawn in that page.

# To DO

- Transfer the content from FCC for each related policy section.
- Add an admin section to associate cross selling opportunities for each policy section.
- Fix minor styling issues.

# Legal Disclaimer

I hold no copyrights on the content. The structure of the form is extracted from: FCC Cyber Planner: [https://www.fcc.gov/cyberplanner](https://www.fcc.gov/cyberplanner)
